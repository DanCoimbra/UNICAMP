* [Exercise 01: Lottery Simulation](tarefa01)
  * Simulates a slightly complex lottery with up to a thousand betters.

* [Exercise 02: Teacher's Alumni Resource Manager](tarefa02)
  * Implements abstract data structures (ADT) whose interfaces allow a professor to insert and retrieve structured information about alumni.

* [Exercise 03: Search Engine Utilities](tarefa03)
  * Classifies search terms relative to relevance based on their search statistics, penalizing terms which appear to figure in automated (bot) search procedures.

* [Exercise 04: Backtracking Recursion (Word Search Puzzle Solver)](tarefa04)
  * Uses backtracking recursion to find words in a word search puzzle.

* [Exercise 05: Linked List (Arbitrarily Large Number Calculator)](tarefa05)
  * Creates and employs linked lists to store arbitrarily large numbers. Implements summation, subtraction, multiplication, and division for these numbers / lists. Memory has been dynamically allocated and there are no memory leaks. (The same can be said of all exercises below.)

* [Exercise 06: Double-Ended Queue (Hospital Waiting Rooms)](tarefa06)
  * Creates and employs double-ended queues with malloc to manage patients in a hospital containing multiple waiting lines, one for each ward / medical specialty.

* [Exercise 07: Binary Search Tree (Cryptography Adventure Game)](tarefa07)
  * Creates and employs a binary search tree with malloc to store coded messages and decode them.

* [Exercise 08: Left-leaning Red-black Binary Search Tree (Number Sequence Game)](tarefa08)
  * Creates and employs a specific kind of binary search tree to store arbitrarily large integer sequences. Decides efficiently whether an integer sequence is "cool". An integer sequence S is cool if and only if ∀n∈S(n occurs n times in S). For example, if 3 occurs in the sequence, then it must occur exactly three times. Also decides efficiently how many integers must be removed from an uncool sequence in order to turn it into a cool one.

* [Exercise 09: Heap (Uber Race System)](tarefa09)
  * Creates and employs a heap data structure to implement an Uber race system, where users can solicit and cancel races, while drivers can accept and finish races. Terminates by displaying the driver's costs and revenue.

* [Exercise 10: Hash Map (Word-correction System)](tarefa10)
  * Creates and employs a hash map to efficiently implement a word-correction system. Given a "correct word dictionary", it informs whether a given word is incorrect. Additionally, it informs whether a word is one typo away from a correct word: whether it has an extra character, a missing character, or two switched characters.

* [Exercise 11: Graph (Optimal Path Calculation)](tarefa11)
  * Creates and employs a graph to efficiently deermine an optimal path for a player in a virtual scenario. The game very roughly simulates the smartphone game "Pokémon Go". The player wishes to traverse multiple PokéStops to reach a major battle, and the optimization task is to minimize the maximum distance between any two PokéStops, among all different possible paths in the graph.

* [Exercise 12: Spreadsheet (Excel Simulator)](tarefa12)
  * Simulates a spreadsheet that not only reads and writes tabular data, but also parses and resolves cross-reference formulae such as "=A0" and "=(A0 + B1) + C2". It also detects closed loops: if A0 says "=B0" and B0 says "=A0", a warning pops up.
